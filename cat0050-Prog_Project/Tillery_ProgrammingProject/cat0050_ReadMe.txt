  NAME: CHRISTOPHER TILLERY
  *NOTE: It may take a few seconds for the main method to write to the output file. The value of n used for the purpose of timing is
	 2500 so each algorithm is executing 19 * 2500 times.

  FILES INCLUDED IN SUBMISSION:
	- cat0050_charts.pdf 			// File containing charts of the estimated and measured time for all four algorithms
	- cat0050_complexities.pdf		// File containing the work for all cost and complexities tables
	- ChristopherTillery_phw_output.txt	// Output file used to chart time
	- phw_intput.txt			// Input file used for testing algorithms
	- AlgorithmImplementations.cpp		// Source code for the algorithm implementations

  COMPILATION:
	- Developed using C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio. The code was run using Debugging Mode.
